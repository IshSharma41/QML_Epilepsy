# 2. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for Artifact Removal (EEG)

    ica = ICA(n_components=n_components, random_state=97, max_iter='auto')

# Details:
# - Function: ica_artifact_removal
# - Algorithm: Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
# - Rationale: Decomposes EEG signals into independent components, allowing for the identification and removal of artifact components.
# - Justification: Effective for removing complex artifacts like eye blinks and muscle activity that are difficult to remove with simple thresholding.
